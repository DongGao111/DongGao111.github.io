**Location: Shanghai**

**1. Firm Context**

A leading China-based quantitative fund with tens of billions RMB in AUM and a long-standing top-tier performance record.

The firm has demonstrated consistent alpha generation across multiple market cycles and operates with institutional-level capital discipline and risk management rigor.

It is now expanding into global equity markets and building out a dedicated systematic long/short platform. This hire will join at the formation stage of that global mandate.

---
**2. Platform Characteristics**

What structurally differentiates this platform:
- Proven Performance Stability – Sustained, repeatable alpha rather than short-cycle outperformance.
- Organizational Stability – Significantly lower employee turnover relative to industry peers.
- Research Continuity – Long-term retention of core researchers enables cumulative intellectual capital.
- Research-First Culture – High autonomy, minimal internal friction, and limited non-research overhead.

The firm combines scale, stability, and research depth — a rare combination within the domestic quant landscape.

**3. Role Mandate**

The firm is seeking a Senior Quant Researcher specializing in systematic equity long/short strategies to join as a founding member of the global trading team.

Core responsibilities include:
- Developing cross-sectional equity alpha signals
- Participating in portfolio construction and risk budgeting
- Designing optimization frameworks and turnover control mechanisms
- Supporting strategy scaling across global equity markets

The ideal candidate will have experience in both:
- Alpha research (signal generation, validation, robustness testing)
- Portfolio construction (risk allocation, capacity awareness, implementation discipline)

This role requires strategy-level thinking beyond single-signal contribution.

---
**4. Compensation**

Compensation is positioned at the top tier of the industry.

Total annual compensation typically ranges from USD 500K to 1.2M, aligned with global systematic standards and structured around performance contribution and long-term strategy impact.

Economics are designed to reward durable alpha and scalable platform contribution.

---
**5. Evaluation Focus**

Assessment centers on:
- Depth and originality of alpha generation
- Portfolio construction methodology
- Risk awareness and scalability understanding
- Research independence and structural thinking

Process is merit-driven and decision-efficient.
