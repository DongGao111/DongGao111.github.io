Technology Lead (Open to CTO)

Location: Hong Kong

---
1. Firm Context
A newly launching hedge fund platform in Hong Kong, backed by multi-billion USD capital commitments from leading Wall Street institutions.
The fund will operate a global systematic equities strategy under a centralized book structure, initially focused on Asia and Europe.
This is not an incremental expansion.
It is a full platform build — capital secured, infrastructure being formed, core team under construction.
The firm is currently assembling its early core Quant and technology leadership team, offering competitive economics and meaningful long-term upside aligned with platform growth.

2. Platform Vision
The mandate is to build a globally scalable systematic trading and AI research platform from 0→1.
Key characteristics:
- Centralized book, global systematic equities
- Architecture-first build
- Deep integration of quant research, execution, and AI infrastructure
- Founding-level technical ownership
This is a structural build phase, not a maintenance environment.
