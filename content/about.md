I’m Dong Gao, the founder of SUPER QUANT, a specialist executive search firm focused on top-tier talent in quantitative finance.

While my work sits in recruiting, my primary interest has always been upstream of hiring itself — how alpha is actually produced, how organizations make decisions under constraints, and why certain roles become critical at specific moments.

I work closely with decision-makers at leading quant funds, typically recommending very few people, and only where I believe the fit is structurally sound over the long term.

On this site, I write down my current observations and thinking about the quant industry, along with reading notes and questions I believe are worth taking seriously. The goal is not to be comprehensive or timely, but to build ideas and perspectives that can stand the test of time.
