title: "Essays"
description: "These essays are an attempt to think clearly, in public, about quantitative finance, hiring, and decision-making.\n\nRather than chasing trends or providing quick conclusions, I use this space to examine the underlying structures that tend to matter over time — how alpha is created and erodes, how incentives shape behavior, and how organizations respond to constraints.\n\nMost of what I write here starts from questions, not answers, and many of these essays are meant to be revisited and revised as my understanding evolves."
